# Welcome

Welcome to Bits and Bolts, and thanks for taking the time to be here.

My name is Konstantinos Laos, and this blog documents my transition from working as a car mechanic to building a career in cybersecurity. This blog exists both as a personal learning log and as a place to share practical knowledge with others who are on a similar path.

## From Mechanical Systems to Digital Security

Working as a mechanic taught me how to approach complex systems methodically. Diagnosing faults, understanding how components interact, and fixing problems under real-world pressure are skills that translate surprisingly well into cybersecurity.

Over time, my interest shifted toward technology, networks, and security. That curiosity turned into structured learning, certifications, and hands-on projects. This blog is where I track that progress and reflect on what I learn along the way.

## What This Blog Is About

Here you’ll find content focused on learning by doing. Topics will include:

- Cybersecurity fundamentals, networking, and system security  
- Ethical hacking concepts, labs, and practical exercises  
- Python scripting and automation related to security  
- Cloud security concepts and modern infrastructure  
- Study notes and lessons learned from certifications  
- Thoughts and advice on transitioning into cybersecurity from a non-traditional background  

I’ll aim to keep things practical, honest, and approachable. If something doesn’t work, I’ll write about that too.

## Who This Is For

This blog is intended for:
- People starting out in cybersecurity or IT  
- Career changers coming from hands-on or technical trades  
- Students and self-learners looking for real-world perspective  
- Anyone interested in how security concepts apply in practice  

You don’t need an advanced background to follow along. I’m still learning, and this blog reflects that process.

## Moving Forward

My goal is simple: to learn continuously, build real skills, and share what I discover along the way. If any of this is useful to you, or if you want to exchange ideas or collaborate on projects, feel free to reach out.

Thanks for reading, and welcome.
