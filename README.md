# ⚙️ Bolts and Bits

Welcome to **Bolts and Bits**, my corner of the internet where cars meet code.  
This site documents my ongoing transition from a career in **automotive mechanics** to the world of **IT and cybersecurity** — a space where I share personal projects, articles, and notes from my learning journey.

## 🧰 What This Site Is

**Bolts and Bits** isn’t just a blog — it’s a timeline of my shift into tech.  
Here you’ll find:
- Write-ups on **cybersecurity news** and **industry events** I attend  
- My **GitHub projects** as I learn and build  
- Occasional thoughts on what it’s like to rebuild a career from the ground up  

The site runs on **Jekyll** using the **Type on Strap** theme, and it’s hosted right here on **GitHub Pages**.  
It’s open source by design — simple, minimal, and easy to maintain.

## 🧠 What I’m Working Toward

I’m learning and developing skills in:
- **System and Network Administration**  
- **Cybersecurity Operations** and **Threat Analysis**  
- **Python scripting** for automation and security tools  
- **Cloud Security** concepts and practices  

I believe in learning by doing — building, breaking, fixing, and sharing what I find along the way.

## 🏅 Background

Before this journey, I worked as a **car mechanic**.  
That background shaped how I approach IT: with the same curiosity and persistence needed to diagnose mechanical faults — only now, it’s systems and networks instead of engines and wiring.

Along the way, I’ve earned certifications like:
- CompTIA A+  
- (ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)  
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate  
- Cisco Certificate in Ethical Hacking

### ⚡ A Note

“Bolts and Bits” comes from the idea that whether it’s engines or computers, everything runs on well-placed pieces working together — and I’m just learning how to tighten the digital ones.
